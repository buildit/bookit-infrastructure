# 4. Use Cloudwatch Logs for log aggregation

Date: 2017-10-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Logs are generated by each instance of a container.  We need the ability to see and search across all instances.

## Decision

We will use Cloudwatch Logs to aggregate our logs.  We will utliize Cloudwatch Alarms to notify when ERROR logs are generated

## Consequences

For now we just stream whatever is generated to STDOUT.  Configuring the log agent to tail log files will need to be figured out.
